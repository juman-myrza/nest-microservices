## Overview

This project is a demonstration of a microservices architecture using Nest.js framework. It aims to showcase the scalability, modularity, and maintainability that microservices offer, combined with the productivity and flexibility of Nest.js.

## Features

- **Microservices Architecture**: The project is divided into small, independent services, each responsible for a specific domain or functionality.
- **Nest.js Framework**: Utilizes Nest.js, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.
- **Docker**: Docker containers are used to encapsulate each microservice, making deployment and scaling easier and more consistent.
- **RESTful API**: Each microservice exposes a RESTful API, allowing easy communication between services.
- **Database Integration**: Integrates with MongoDB.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the microservices and API endpoints.
- **Payment**: Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the microservices and API endpoints.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Utilizes logging and monitoring tools to track and analyze the performance and behavior of the microservices.
- **Testing**: Includes unit tests, integration tests, and possibly end-to-end tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the microservices.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   cd project-name
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**:

   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required environment variables for your development, staging, and production environments.

4. **Start the Services**:

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

## Usage

Describe how to use the APIs provided by the microservices. Include examples of requests and responses, authentication mechanisms, and any other relevant details.
